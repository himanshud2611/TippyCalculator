# TippyCalculator
An Android App - Tip Calculator
I'd used the ConstraintLayout for the layout and two event listeners for the app logic. After you enter a base amount and a tip percentage, the app will calculate the tip and total for you.
Also implemented a tip percentage animation and a footer to make  app more unique
